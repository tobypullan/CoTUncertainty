Specifically, they have a duty to act for the benefit of the company, plus two other duties.

That would conflict with acting in the company's interest. So the second blank can't be self-interest.\n\nSo between F and B, F has Care and Skill, which I think is correct, but the third blank is Diligence. Wait, what's Diligence?

The question is about where morality is located—whether it's in the sphere of rationality or in an emotional 'moral impulse' towards others. The options are from A to J, each representing different ethical theories.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means. Let me go through them one by one.\n\nOption A is Ethical Egoism. I remember that this theory suggests that the morality of an action is determined by how it affects the individual who is acting. So, the focus is on self-interest and consequences for the actor, not others. That doesn't sound like where emotions are the main factor, but more about self-interest.\n\nOption B is Ethics of Duty. This is also called Deontological Ethics. It's based on the idea that certain duties are inherent, regardless of the consequences. So, for example, stealing is wrong because it violates a moral duty, not because it's the worst outcome. This seems more rule-based and rational, so probably not where emotions are the main driver.\n\nOption C is Postmodern Ethics. I'm not too familiar with this one. I think postmodernism deals with skepticism about grand narratives and emphasizes plurality and context. But I'm not sure how that ties into morality. Maybe it's more about relativism or uncertainty, but I'm not certain.\n\nOption D is Consequentialist Ethics. This is about the outcomes of actions. The morality is determined by the consequences—whether the action brings more good or harm. So, it's outcome-based, which could involve emotions if the outcomes evoke strong feelings, but it's more about the logical consequences.\n\nOption E is Utilitarian Ethics. This is similar to Consequentialism, where the best outcome is chosen. It's based on maximizing utility, so it's all about the consequences and outcomes. Utilitarianism definitely looks at the consequences and could involve emotional responses to the outcomes, but it's still rational in that it's about maximizing happiness or minimizing suffering.\n\nOption F is Deontological Ethics. Wait, that's the same as Ethics of Duty. So, same as B, focusing on duties and rules, not outcomes.\n\nOption G is Virtue Ethics. This focuses on the character of the person acting. It's about the virtues of the agent, like honesty, kindness, etc. So, it's more about the person's moral character rather than the action's consequences. But does that involve",
