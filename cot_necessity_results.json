The question says that typical advertising regulatory bodies suggest that adverts must not encourage certain things, cause unnecessary things, or something else. I need to figure out what those blanks are filled with.\n\nThe options are A through I, each with different combinations of words. Let's read the question again: \"must not: encourage _________, cause unnecessary ________ or _____, and must not cause _______ offence.\"\n\nSo, the first blank is something the ads shouldn't encourage. The second is something they shouldn't cause unnecessary. The third is another action they shouldn't cause. The fourth is a type of offence.\n\nI remember that advertising laws aim to prevent certain negative impacts. Let's think about each part.\n\nFirst, what do ads usually try to avoid encouraging? Well, they don't want ads that promote unsafe practices. Like, if an ad tells people to do something dangerous, that's bad. So maybe \"unsafe practices\" is the first word. Alternatively, the options don't all have that. Looking at the options, let's see which ones have \"unsafe\" or \"safe.\"\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) Safe practices, Fear, Jealousy, Trivial\nB) Unsafe practices, Distress, Joy, Trivial\nC) Safe practices, Wants, Jealousy, Trivial\nD) Safe practices, Distress, Fear, Trivial\nE) Unsafe practices, Wants, Jealousy, Serious\nF) Safe practices, Distress, Jealousy, Serious\nG) Safe practices, Wants, Fear, Serious\nH) Unsafe practices, Wants, Fear, Trivial\nI) Unsafe practices, Distress, Fear, Serious\n\nSo, the first blank in options B, E, H, I is \"unsafe practices.\" The others have \"safe practices,\" which don't make sense because the first word is about what ads shouldn't encourage. They should be promoting safe things, not encouraging unsafe.\n\nSo the first blank is probably \"unsafe practices.\" That narrows it down to options B, E, H, I.\n\nNext, the second blank: cause unnecessary something. What does an ad cause unnecessary? Probably distress or something else negative. For example, ads about products that cause harm, like excessive alcohol, can cause distress. So the second blank might be \"distress.\"\n\nLooking at the options, let's see:\n\nB) first blank unsafe, second distress",
