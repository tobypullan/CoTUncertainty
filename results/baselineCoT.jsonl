Let's analyze each option:\n\n*   **A) Planetary density will decrease.** Density is mass/volume.

This is unlikely.\n*   **C) Planetary days will become shorter.** A day is defined by the time it takes for a planet to complete one rotation. If the planet rotates faster, it will take *less* time to complete one rotation. Therefore, days will become shorter.
