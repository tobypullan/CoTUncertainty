Hmm, vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, but the numerator isn't zero at those points, right? So first, I should factor the denominator to find its roots.\n\nLet me try factoring x² + x - 6. I'm looking for two numbers that multiply to -6 and add up to 1. Let's see, 3 and -2 work because 3 * (-2) = -6 and 3 + (-2) = 1. So, the denominator factors to (x + 3)(x - 2). That means the function can be rewritten as y = 2/[(x + 3)(x - 2)].\n\nNow, the denominator is zero when x + 3 = 0 or x - 2 = 0, which gives x = -3 and x = 2. I should check if the numerator is zero at these points. The numerator is just 2, which is not zero, so both x = -3 and x = 2 are vertical asymptotes.\n\nWait, are there any other possibilities?

I need to express x as a common fraction. Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that the ceiling function, denoted by ⎡x⎤, gives the smallest integer greater than or equal to x. So, if x is not an integer, the ceiling of x is the next integer up. For example, if x is 2.3, then ⎡x⎤ is 3.\n\nGiven that, the equation is ⎡x⎤ + x = 23/7. Let me write that down: ⎡x⎤ + x = 23/7.\n\nI think I should let n be the ceiling of x, so n = ⎡x⎤. Since n is the ceiling, that means n - 1 < x ≤ n. Because if x were equal to n, then the ceiling would still be n, but if x is less than n, it's greater than n - 1.\n\nSo, substituting n into the equation, we have n + x = 23/7. Therefore, x = 23/7 - n.\n\nBut since n is an integer and x is a fraction, I can express x as 23/7 - n. Now, I also know that n - 1 < x ≤ n. So, substituting x from above, we get n - 1 < 23/7 - n ≤ n.\n\nLet me solve this inequality step by step. First, let's write it as two separate inequalities:\n\n1. n - 1 < 23/7 - n\n2. 23/7 - n ≤ n\n\nStarting with the first inequality: n - 1 < 23/7 - n.\n\nLet me solve for n. I'll add n to both sides: 2n - 1 < 23/7.\n\nThen, add 1 to both sides: 2n < 23/7 + 1.\n\nBut 1 is 7/7, so 23/7 + 7/7 = 30/7. So, 2n < 30/7.\n\nDivide both sides by 2: n < 15/7. 15 divided by 7 is approximately 2.142. Since n is an integer, the possible values are n ≤ 2.\n\nNow, let's look at the second inequality: 23/7 - n ≤ n.\n\nAdding n to both sides: 23/7 ≤ 2n.\n\nDivide both sides by 2: 23/14 ≤ n.\n\n23 divided by 14 is approximately 1.642. So, n must be greater than or equal to 2 because n is an integer. Wait, but from the first inequality, n < 15/7 ≈ 2.142, so n must be less than 2.142. Since n is an integer, the only possible value is n = 2.\n\nLet me check if n = 2 satisfies both inequalities.\n\nFirst inequality: 2 - 1 < 23/7 - 2. That simplifies to 1 < 23/7 - 14/7 = 9/7. 9/7 is approximately 1.285, so 1 < 1.285, which is true.\n\nSecond inequality: 23/7 - 2 ≤ 2. 23/7 - 14/7 = 9/7 ≈ 1.285, which is ≤ 2, so that's true as well.\n\nSo, n = 2 is the correct ceiling value. Now, substituting back into x = 23/7 - n, we get x = 23/7 - 2.\n\nConvert 2 to sevenths: 2 = 14/7. So, x = 23/7 - 14/7 = 9/7.\n\nWait, but 9/7 is approximately 1.285, and the ceiling of 9/7 is 2, which matches n = 2. So, let's verify the original equation: ⎡9/7⎤ + 9/7 = 2 + 9/7 = 14/7 + 9/7 = 23/7, which is correct.\n\nSo, x is 9/7. But wait, 9/7 is an improper fraction. The problem says to express x as a common fraction, which can be either proper or improper, so 9/7 is fine.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check.

Hmm, I remember that \\(i\\) is the imaginary unit, where \\(i^2 = -1\\). But I'm a bit fuzzy on the higher powers, so let me think through each term step by step.\n\nStarting with \\(i^5\\). I know that the powers of \\(i\\) cycle every four exponents. So, \\(i^1 = i\\), \\(i^2 = -1\\), \\(i^3 = -i\\), and \\(i^4 = 1\\). Then it repeats: \\(i^5 = i^1\\), \\(i^6 = i^2\\), and so on. So, to find \\(i^5\\), I can divide 5 by 4 and find the remainder. 5 divided by 4 is 1 with a remainder of 1. That means \\(i^5 = i^1 = i\\).\n\nNext, \\(i^{-25}\\). Negative exponents mean reciprocals, so \\(i^{-25} = 1/(i^{25})\\). But dealing with negative exponents can be tricky, so maybe it's easier to express it using positive exponents. I remember that \\(i^{-1} = -i\\) because \\(i \\times (-i) = 1\\). Alternatively, I can use the fact that \\(i^n\\) cycles every four, so I can find the equivalent positive exponent by adding multiples of 4 until I get a positive exponent.\n\nLet me compute \\(i^{25}\\) first. 25 divided by 4 is 6 with a remainder of 1, so \\(i^{25} = i^1 = i\\). Therefore, \\(i^{-25} = 1/i\\). But \\(1/i\\) can be simplified by multiplying numerator and denominator by \\(i\\): \\(1/i = (1 \\times i)/(i \\times i) = i/(-1) = -i\\). So, \\(i^{-25} = -i\\).\n\nNow, \\(i^{45}\\).

I need to find the value of x. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I remember that when dealing with exponential equations, it's helpful to express both sides with the same base if possible. That way, I can set the exponents equal to each other. So, let's see if I can rewrite 4 as a power of 2 because I know 4 is 2 squared.\n\nSo, 4 is 2². That means 4^x is the same as (2²)^x. Wait, how does that exponent rule work again? Oh right, when you raise a power to another power, you multiply the exponents. So, (2²)^x becomes 2^(2x).\n\nNow, the original equation was 2^8 = 4^x, which I've rewritten as 2^8 = 2^(2x). Since the bases are the same (both are base 2), I can set the exponents equal to each other. That gives me 8 = 2x.\n\nTo solve for x, I just need to divide both sides by 2.

That makes sense.\n\nNow, to find the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, there's a formula I remember: aₙ = a₁ + (n - 1)d. Let me make sure I recall this correctly. Yeah, it's the first term plus the number of steps multiplied by the common difference.

A is $1225, P is $1000, and t is 3 years. So, the equation becomes 1225 = 1000*(1 + r)^3.\n\nTo find r, I'll first divide both sides by 1000. That gives me 1225/1000 = (1 + r)^3.

When you add them in pairs, you get the sums: 10, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 29. I need to figure out what these four integers are and list them in increasing order.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have four numbers and you add them pairwise, you get six sums. The smallest sum should be the sum of the two smallest numbers, and the largest sum should be the sum of the two largest numbers. So, in this case, the smallest sum is 10 and the largest is 29. That means a + b = 10 and c + d = 29.\n\nNext, I think about the total sum of all four numbers. If I add up all the pairwise sums, I'm effectively adding each number three times. So, the total of all six sums is 10 + 18 + 19 + 20 + 21 + 29. Let me calculate that: 10 + 18 is 28, plus 19 is 47, plus 20 is 67, plus 21 is 88, plus 29 is 117. So, the total is 117, which equals 3(a + b + c + d). Therefore, a + b + c + d = 117 / 3 = 39.\n\nSince I already know that a + b = 10 and c + d = 29, the total sum of 39 makes sense because 10 + 29 = 39.\n\nNow, I need to find the individual values of a, b, c, and d. I know that the next smallest sum after 10 would be a + c, and the next largest sum before 29 would be b + d. Let's list the sums in order: 10, 18, 19, 20, 21, 29.\n\nSo, the second smallest sum is 18, which should be a + c. The second largest sum is 21, which should be b + d.

Since a + b = 10, then c + d must be 29, which checks out.\n\nLet me try to solve these equations step by step. From equation 1, a = 10 - b. Plugging this into equation 2: (10 - b) + c = 18. Simplifying, 10 - b + c = 18 → -b + c = 8 → c = b + 8.\n\nNow, looking at equation 4: c + d = 29. Since c = b + 8, then (b + 8) + d = 29 → b + d = 21. But wait, equation 3 is b + d = 21, so that's consistent. So, from equation 3, d = 21 - b.\n\nNow, let's use the total sum: a + b + c + d = 39. We know a = 10 - b, c = b + 8, and d = 21 - b. Plugging these into the total sum:\n\n(10 - b) + b + (b + 8) + (21 - b) = 39.\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\n10 - b + b + b + 8 + 21 - b.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n10 + 8 + 21 + (-b + b + b - b) = 39.\n\nSimplify the constants: 10 + 8 is 18, plus 21 is 39. The b terms cancel out: (-b + b) is 0, and (b - b) is also 0. So, 39 = 39. That doesn't give me new information, so I need another approach.\n\nLet me look at the remaining sums: 19 and 20. These should correspond to a + d and b + c. Since the sums are 10, 18, 19, 20, 21, 29, the next sums after 18 are 19 and 20.

Express your answer as a common fraction.", "gold_answer": "-\\frac{1}{8}", "baseline_seed": 91234, "baseline_cot": "Okay, so I have this equation: |5x - 1| = |3x + 2|. I need to find the smallest value of x that satisfies this equation. Hmm, absolute value equations can sometimes have two solutions because the expressions inside can be equal or opposites. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that if |A| = |B|, then either A = B or A = -B. So, applying that here, I can set up two separate equations.\n\nThe first case is when 5x - 1 equals 3x + 2. Let me solve that:\n\n5x - 1 = 3x + 2\n\nSubtract 3x from both sides:\n\n2x - 1 = 2\n\nAdd 1 to both sides:\n\n2x = 3\n\nDivide by 2:\n\nx = 3/2\n\nOkay, so that's one solution, x = 3/2.\n\nNow, the second case is when 5x - 1 equals the negative of 3x + 2. So:\n\n5x - 1 = -(3x + 2)\n\nLet me distribute the negative sign on the right side:\n\n5x - 1 = -3x - 2\n\nNow, add 3x to both sides:\n\n8x - 1 = -2\n\nAdd 1 to both sides:\n\n8x = -1\n\nDivide by 8:\n\nx = -1/8\n\nSo, the two solutions are x = 3/2 and x = -1/8. The problem asks for the smallest value of x, so I need to compare these two. Since -1/8 is less than 3/2, the smallest value is -1/8.\n\nWait, let me double-check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with the first case:\n\n5x - 1 = 3x + 2\n\nSubtract 3x: 2x -1 = 2\n\nAdd 1: 2x = 3\n\nDivide: x = 3/2. That looks correct.\n\nSecond case:\n\n5x - 1 = -3x - 2\n\nAdd 3x: 8x -1 = -2\n\nAdd 1: 8x = -1\n\nDivide: x = -1/8. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, yes, the solutions are correct, and the smallest x is -1/8.\n</think>\n\nTo solve |5x - 1| = |3x + 2|, consider two cases:\n\n1. **Case 1:** 5x - 1 = 3x + 2  \n   Subtract 3x: 2x - 1 = 2  \n   Add 1: 2x = 3  \n   Divide: x = 3/2\n\n2. **Case 2:** 5x - 1 = -(3x + 2)  \n   Distribute: 5x - 1 = -3x - 2  \n   Add 3x: 8x - 1 = -2  \n   Add 1: 8x = -1  \n   Divide: x = -1/8\n\nThe smallest value of x is -1/8.", "baseline_pred": "-\\frac{1}{8}", "baseline_correct": true}
