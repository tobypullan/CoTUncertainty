Hmm, vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, but the numerator isn't zero at those points, right? So first, I should factor the denominator to find its roots.\n\nLet me try factoring x² + x - 6. I'm looking for two numbers that multiply to -6 and add up to 1. Let's see, 3 and -2 work because 3 * (-2) = -6 and 3 + (-2) = 1. So, the denominator factors to (x + 3)(x - 2). That means the function can be rewritten as y = 2/[(x + 3)(x - 2)].\n\nNow, the denominator is zero when x + 3 = 0 or x - 2 = 0, which gives x = -3 and x = 2. I should check if the numerator is zero at these points. The numerator is just 2, which is not zero, so both x = -3 and x = 2 are vertical asymptotes.\n\nWait, are there any other possibilities? The denominator is a quadratic, so it can only have two real roots, which we've found. So, that should be all the vertical asymptotes.\n\nI think that's it. The function has two vertical asymptotes at x = -3 and x = 2.\n</think>\n\nTo find the vertical asymptotes of \\( y = \\frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \\), factor the denominator:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + x - 6 = (x + 3)(x - 2)\n\\]\n\nThe function becomes \\( y = \\frac{2}{(x + 3)(x - 2)} \\).

      "baseline_cot": "Okay, so I need to evaluate the expression \\(i^5 + i^{-25} + i^{45}\\). Hmm, I remember that \\(i\\) is the imaginary unit, where \\(i^2 = -1\\). But I'm a bit fuzzy on the higher powers, so let me think through each term step by step.\n\nStarting with \\(i^5\\). I know that the powers of \\(i\\) cycle every four exponents. So, \\(i^1 = i\\), \\(i^2 = -1\\), \\(i^3 = -i\\), and \\(i^4 = 1\\). Then it repeats: \\(i^5 = i^1\\), \\(i^6 = i^2\\), and so on. So, to find \\(i^5\\), I can divide 5 by 4 and find the remainder. 5 divided by 4 is 1 with a remainder of 1. That means \\(i^5 = i^1 = i\\).\n\nNext, \\(i^{-25}\\). Negative exponents mean reciprocals, so \\(i^{-25} = 1/(i^{25})\\). But dealing with negative exponents can be tricky, so maybe it's easier to express it using positive exponents. I remember that \\(i^{-1} = -i\\) because \\(i \\times (-i) = 1\\). Alternatively, I can use the fact that \\(i^n\\) cycles every four, so I can find the equivalent positive exponent by adding multiples of 4 until I get a positive exponent.\n\nLet me compute \\(i^{25}\\) first. 25 divided by 4 is 6 with a remainder of 1, so \\(i^{25} = i^1 = i\\). Therefore, \\(i^{-25} = 1/i\\). But \\(1/i\\) can be simplified by multiplying numerator and denominator by \\(i\\): \\(1/i = (1 \\times i)/(i \\times i) = i/(-1) = -i\\). So, \\(i^{-25} = -i\\).\n\nNow, \\(i^{45}\\). Again, I'll use the cycle of four. 45 divided by 4 is 11 with a remainder of 1, so \\(i^{45} = i^1 = i\\).\n\nPutting it all together: \\(i^5 + i^{-25} + i^{45} = i + (-i) + i\\). Let's compute this step by step. \\(i + (-i) = 0\\), and then 0 + i = i. So the total sum is \\(i\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For \\(i^5\\), yes, 5 mod 4 is 1, so \\(i\\). For \\(i^{-25}\\), I converted it to \\(1/i^{25}\\), which is \\(1/i\\) since 25 mod 4 is 1, and then simplified that to \\(-i\\). For \\(i^{45}\\), 45 mod 4 is 1, so \\(i\\). Adding them up: \\(i - i + i = i\\). Yep, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate \\(i^5 + i^{-25} + i^{45}\\):\n\n1. **\\(i^5\\):** Since \\(i\\) cycles every 4 exponents, \\(5 \\mod 4 = 1\\). Thus, \\(i^5 = i^1 = i\\).\n\n2. **\\(i^{-25}\\):** Convert to a positive exponent: \\(i^{-25} = 1/i^{25}\\). \\(25 \\mod 4 = 1\\), so \\(i^{25} = i\\). Therefore, \\(1/i = -i\\) (since \\(1/i = -i\\)).\n\n3. **\\(i^{45}\\):** \\(45 \\mod 4 = 1\\), so \\(i^{45} = i^1 = i\\).\n\nAdding them together: \\(i + (-i) + i = i\\).",

      "baseline_cot": "Okay, so I've got this equation here: 2 to the power of 8 equals 4 to the power of x. I need to find the value of x. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I remember that when dealing with exponential equations, it's helpful to express both sides with the same base if possible. That way, I can set the exponents equal to each other. So, let's see if I can rewrite 4 as a power of 2 because I know 4 is 2 squared.\n\nSo, 4 is 2². That means 4^x is the same as (2²)^x. Wait, how does that exponent rule work again? Oh right, when you raise a power to another power, you multiply the exponents. So, (2²)^x becomes 2^(2x).\n\nNow, the original equation was 2^8 = 4^x, which I've rewritten as 2^8 = 2^(2x). Since the bases are the same (both are base 2), I can set the exponents equal to each other. That gives me 8 = 2x.\n\nTo solve for x, I just need to divide both sides by 2. So, x equals 8 divided by 2, which is 4.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. If x is 4, then 4^4 should equal 2^8. Calculating 4^4: 4*4 is 16, 16*4 is 64, 64*4 is 256. And 2^8 is 256 as well. Yep, that checks out. So, x must be 4.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(2^8 = 4^x\\), we first express 4 as a power of 2: \\(4 = 2^2\\). Substituting this into the equation gives:\n\n\\[\n2^8 = (2^2)^x\n\\]\n\nUsing the power rule \\((a^m)^n = a^{mn}\\), we simplify the right side:\n\n\\[\n2^8 = 2^{2x}\n\\]\n\nSince the bases are equal, we set the exponents equal:\n\n\\[\n8 = 2x\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{8}{2} = 4\n\\]",

      "gold_answer": "402",
      "baseline_cot": "Okay, so I need to find the 100th term of this arithmetic sequence: 6, 10, 14, 18, and so on. Hmm, arithmetic sequences have a common difference between consecutive terms, right? Let me check that first.\n\nLooking at the given terms:\n- The first term (a₁) is 6.\n- The second term is 10, so the difference here is 10 - 6 = 4.\n- The third term is 14, so 14 - 10 = 4 again.\n- The fourth term is 18, so 18 - 14 = 4.\n\nAlright, so the common difference (d) is 4. That makes sense.\n\nNow, to find the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, there's a formula I remember: aₙ = a₁ + (n - 1)d. Let me make sure I recall this correctly. Yeah, it's the first term plus the number of steps multiplied by the common difference. Each step adds d, so for the nth term, there are (n - 1) steps after the first term.\n\nSo, plugging in the values I have:\n- a₁ = 6\n- d = 4\n- n = 100 (since I'm looking for the 100th term)\n\nLet me write that out: a₁₀₀ = 6 + (100 - 1) * 4.\n\nCalculating inside the parentheses first: 100 - 1 = 99.\n\nThen, 99 * 4. Let me do that multiplication step by step to avoid mistakes:\n- 100 * 4 = 400, so 99 * 4 should be 400 - 4 = 396.\n\nSo, a₁₀₀ = 6 + 396.\n\nAdding those together: 6 + 396 = 402.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any errors. \n\n1. Identified the common difference correctly: 4. Yes, each term increases by 4.\n2. Used the correct formula: aₙ = a₁ + (n - 1)d. Yes, that's the standard formula.\n3. Plugged in the right values: a₁ = 6, n = 100, d = 4. Correct.\n4. Calculated 100 - 1 = 99. Correct.\n5. Multiplied 99 by 4: 99 * 4. Let me verify that again. 100 * 4 is 400, so 99 * 4 is indeed 400 - 4 = 396. That's right.\n6. Added 6 + 396: 6 + 396 is 402. Yep, that adds up.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, the 100th term should be 402.\n</think>\n\nTo find the 100th term of the arithmetic sequence 6, 10, 14, 18, ..., we use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:\n\n\\[\na_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d\n\\]\n\nHere:\n- \\( a_1 = 6 \\) (first term)\n- \\( d = 4 \\) (common difference)\n- \\( n = 100 \\) (term number)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\na_{100} = 6 + (100 - 1) \\times 4 = 6 + 99 \\times 4 = 6 + 396 = 402\n\\]",

Hmm, absolute value equations can sometimes have two solutions because the expressions inside can be equal or opposites. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that if |A| = |B|, then either A = B or A = -B. So, applying that here, I can set up two separate equations.\n\nThe first case is when 5x - 1 equals 3x + 2. Let me solve that:\n\n5x - 1 = 3x + 2\n\nSubtract 3x from both sides:\n\n2x - 1 = 2\n\nAdd 1 to both sides:\n\n2x = 3\n\nDivide by 2:\n\nx = 3/2\n\nOkay, so that's one solution, x = 3/2.\n\nNow, the second case is when 5x - 1 equals the negative of 3x + 2. So:\n\n5x - 1 = -(3x + 2)\n\nLet me distribute the negative sign on the right side:\n\n5x - 1 = -3x - 2\n\nNow, add 3x to both sides:\n\n8x - 1 = -2\n\nAdd 1 to both sides:\n\n8x = -1\n\nDivide by 8:\n\nx = -1/8\n\nSo, the two solutions are x = 3/2 and x = -1/8. The problem asks for the smallest value of x, so I need to compare these two. Since -1/8 is less than 3/2, the smallest value is -1/8.\n\nWait, let me double-check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with the first case:\n\n5x - 1 = 3x + 2\n\nSubtract 3x: 2x -1 = 2\n\nAdd 1: 2x = 3\n\nDivide: x = 3/2.
