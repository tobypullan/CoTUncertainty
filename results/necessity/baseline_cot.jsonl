Hmm, I remember that polar coordinates are represented as (r, θ), where r is the distance from the origin and θ is the angle made with the positive x-axis.\n\nFirst, let me recall the formulas for converting from rectangular (x, y) to polar (r, θ). I think r is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem, so r = sqrt(x² + y²). That makes sense because r is the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by x and y.\n\nIn this case, the point is (0, 3), so x is 0 and y is 3. Plugging into the formula, r = sqrt(0² + 3²) = sqrt(0 + 9) = sqrt(9) = 3. Okay, so r is 3. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, I need to find θ. The formula for θ is usually θ = arctan(y/x), right? But wait, in this case, x is 0, so I can't just do arctan(3/0) because division by zero is undefined. Hmm, so I need to think about what angle θ corresponds to the point (0, 3) in polar coordinates.\n\nSince x is 0, the point lies on the y-axis. If I imagine the unit circle, the point (0, 1) is at θ = π/2. So, scaling that up, (0, 3) should be in the same direction, just further out. Therefore, θ should be π/2 radians.\n\nWait, let me confirm. When x is 0 and y is positive, the angle is indeed π/2. If x were 0 and y negative, it would be 3π/2. So, yes, θ is π/2 here.\n\nSo putting it all together, the polar coordinates are (3, π/2). Let me just visualize this to make sure. Starting from the origin, moving 3 units in the direction of π/2 radians, which is straight up along the y-axis. Yep, that lands at (0, 3) in rectangular coordinates. So that checks out.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The calculation for r was simple, and recognizing the position on the y-axis gave me θ without needing to compute arctan, which would have been undefined in this case. So I'm confident the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the point (0, 3) to polar coordinates:\n\n1.
